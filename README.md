# Monolithic E-Commerce Project

This is a small e-commerce platform built using a **monolithic architecture**. The project combines all functionalities like product management, order processing, and inventory control into a single deployable application.

### Key Features:
- **Product Management:** Easily manage product details such as name, price, and category.
- **Order Processing:** Allow customers to place and manage their orders.
- **Inventory Management:** Keep track of stock levels and update inventory as needed.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for simplicity, making it easy for both users and administrators to navigate.

### Technologies Used:
- **Java & Spring Boot** (for backend development)
- **Spring Data JPA** (for database interaction)
- **H2 Database** (in-memory database for testing purposes)
- **Thymeleaf** (for frontend templating)
- **Maven** (for project build and dependency management)

### How to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the project into your favorite IDE.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Access the application on `localhost:8080`.

### Future Improvements:
- Add authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Implement a real database like **MySQL** for persistent data storage.
- Improve the user interface using **React** or **Angular** for a more dynamic experience.

This project is ideal for learning how to structure a simple monolithic application and demonstrates the core concepts of building an e-commerce platform.
